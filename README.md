# College Student Stress Classifier

A machine learning project that analyzes and classifies stress levels in college students using various psychological and physiological indicators. This project implements multiple classification algorithms to predict student stress levels and provides insights into the most important factors contributing to stress.

## Project Overview

This project uses a dataset of 1,100 college students with 21 different features including:
- **Psychological factors**: Anxiety level, self-esteem, depression, mental health history
- **Physical symptoms**: Headache, blood pressure, sleep quality, breathing problems
- **Environmental factors**: Noise level, living conditions, safety, basic needs
- **Academic factors**: Academic performance, study load, teacher-student relationship
- **Social factors**: Social support, peer pressure, extracurricular activities, bullying
- **Future concerns**: Future career concerns

The target variable is **stress level** classified into three categories (0, 1, 2).

## Objectives

- Analyze college student stress patterns using machine learning
- Compare performance of different classification algorithms
- Identify the most important factors contributing to student stress
- Provide insights for educational institutions and mental health professionals

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11**
- **Machine Learning Libraries**:
  - scikit-learn (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
  - TensorFlow (Neural Networks)
- **Data Analysis**: pandas, numpy
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd stress
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv tfenv
   source tfenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   # or
   tfenv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   source tfenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open and run the main notebook**:
   - Open `main.ipynb`
   - Run all cells to execute the complete analysis
